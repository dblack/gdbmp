<a href="../classes/GDBMP.html">GDBMP</a> &#8212; GDBM with some
class-recognition intelligence

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/GDBMP.html">GDBMP</a> (and in all seriousness, I
can&#8216;t remember why I chose &quot;P&quot;) is a subclass of
Ruby&#8216;s GDBM class, adding the ability to save keys and values that
are of other classes than String. It does this using Marshal. (This was not
the original way; it was a modification suggested by Aaron Patterson. See
History, below.)
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  g = GDBMP.new(&quot;myfile.gdbm&quot;)
  g[:abc] = 1.2
  g[123] = &quot;hi&quot;
  g[1.23] = :symbol

  p g[:abc]   # =&gt; 1.2
  p g[123]    # =&gt; &quot;hi&quot;
</pre>
<p>
etc.
</p>
<h2>Constraining keys to classes</h2>
<p>
You might want to force the value for a certain key to be of a particular
class. For example, if you get form input consisting of strings, you might
want your database to know that some of the strings should be stored as
integers.
</p>
<p>
You can do that with the constrain_key method. Using this method, you
register certain keys along with the desired classes for their values.
</p>
<pre>
  g.constrain_key(:year, Fixnum)
  g[:year] = &quot;1999&quot;

  p g[:year]  # 1999 (the integer, not the string)
</pre>
<p>
The class you constrain a key to has to be represented in the converters
hash, GDBMP::CONVERTERS.
</p>
<p>
You can also add these constraints at the class level:
</p>
<pre>
  class Person &lt; GDBMP
    constrain_key(:age, Fixnum)
    # etc.
  end
</pre>
<p>
On initialization, each instance of the class will pick up the
class&#8216;s constrained keys.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
This library grew from some experiments I was doing involving ActiveModel,
which is part of Rails 3.0 (currently in development). I was playing with
the ActiveModel API which makes it relatively easy to create entire new
backends, relational or otherwise, for ActiveRecord.
</p>
<p>
Aside from just getting GDBM to deal with things other than strings, the
main issue was the need to register specific classes with specific keys
&#8212; which became constrain_key.
</p>
<p>
Originally I was doing the data storage and conversion by saving names of
classes to the database along with the data. Aaron Patterson suggested
using Marshal instead. The problem I saw at first was that there was still
a need to do the key constraining by class. However&#8230; that kind of
solved itself, since as long as the data is marshaled in the correct class,
it will be saved and retrieved in the correct class.
